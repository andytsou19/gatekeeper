    <h2>We are a unique and innovative chrome extension, utilizing machine learning to analyze and provide recommendations to your Youtube watching experience.
      Using Apache Kafka, along with Cassandra, we utilize the Kubernetes paradigm to use the multi-byte Y2K antenna while calculating the primary form factor. Synthesizing frictionless back-end benchmarks, along with proactive e-services, Gatekeeper aggregates user data into an open-source, functional, fluid and best-in-class targeted performance platform.

      Due to national security concerns, integration into the HAARP database will be delayed until Gatekeeper v 2.5.
